# DuckyGame

Ducky loves jumping. Help it jump from platform to platform to climb further up.

Watch out if you jump onto a broken platform, it will disappear after one jump. Also, be careful not to hit a bird, as this will end the game. The higher you climb, the more challenging the game becomes with moving platforms and obstacles to avoid. Keep an eye on your score, and aim to beat your high score each attempt.

To control the player's movements use the LEFT and RIGHT keys.

Good like, folks! ;D
